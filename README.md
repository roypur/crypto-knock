# crypto-knock
An advanced "port knocker" sending signed udp packet instead of port number sequence.

I recommend you use the go implementation of the server. it is more efficient and uses a custom iptable-chain.

sample config file

    {
        "listen":":5005"
        "chain":"CryptoKnock"
        "key":"My√ºberSecretKey"
    }
